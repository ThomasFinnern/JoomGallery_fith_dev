## User login

**Test:**  
The user needs to be logged in, own a category/gallery and is assigned to a user group with certain rights  (Removed but may be reactivated again on need)  
**Actual:**  
The user needs to be logged in and is assigned to a user group with certain rights

### Create site menu for users

According to the expected user type create menu item "User upload" or "User panel" or 
both. See "Set up the menu"

### Enable login module in the front view
Activate the Joomla standard login module:    
Path: Content -> site modules. Here a module "Loginform (Type login)" exists, or it must be created.

Enable the Loginform.

Recommendation: Restrict the appearance to the user... pages. Inside assign a position and select the pages it shall appear
