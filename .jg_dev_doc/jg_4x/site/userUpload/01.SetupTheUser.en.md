## Setup the user

Old: The user needs to be logged in, own a category/gallery and is assigned to a user group with certain rights (May be reactivated though)

The user needs to be logged in, and is assigned to a user group with certain rights

1) Create a user group for userUploads
2) Change the access see below

For each new user do following
1) Create a new user and assign the group

### 1) Create user group "JG user upload"

Create a user group. Here 'JG_user_upload' is used as name. Specify a suitable name. Standard is "JG user upload". Assign "manager" as parent (1). It will appear parallel to administrator. 
					
![User group order](https://github.com/ThomasFinnern/JoomGallery_fith_dev/blob/main/.jg_dev_doc/jg_4x/images/site.UserUpload/user.upload.group.order.en.png?raw=true"  "User group order")

### 2) Set User permissions for upload (login)

### 2A) Find permissions in global JoomGallery configuration

Attention: Please use the global and not local configuration.

Path in Backend: System -> Global configuration -> JoomGallery. Here use tab "Permissions"

![List of system permissions](https://github.com/ThomasFinnern/JoomGallery_fith_dev/blob/main/.jg_dev_doc/jg_4x/images/site.UserUpload/system.permissions.en.png?raw=true"  "List of system permissions")

Assign properties in red/green like in the picture above

This may change in the future as Access in backend may be fixed/improved


### 2B) Assign local permissions for specified group name

Path in Backend: Joom gallery control panel -> "Configuration sets" button -> link Global configuration -> Tab "permissions" -> JoomGallery -> button "Permissions" -> link"

It shall look like below. In fure not all green settings should be needed

![List of joom gallery permissions](https://github.com/ThomasFinnern/JoomGallery_fith_dev/blob/main/.jg_dev_doc/jg_4x/images/site.UserUpload/jg.permissions.en.png?raw=true"  "List of joom gallery permissions")

### 3A) Create new user and assign new group 

For each next user create a Joomla user and assign the above group. Use your specified group name or 'JG User Upload'. 

### 3B) ~~Create new category and assign it to the user~~

May be reactivated 
~~The user needs a initial category/gallery to build on.~~
~~1) Create the category  ~~
~~2) Assign it to the user: Edit the category -> Tab "Publishing" -> property owner -> click ~~on icon on the right side~~
