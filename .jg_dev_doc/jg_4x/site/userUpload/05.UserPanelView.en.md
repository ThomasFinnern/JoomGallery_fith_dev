###  Display user images as manageable

This view part may not be shown as it can be switched off in the menu options

Images are manageable in the sense that they can be reordered and filtered.
Here fewer images are shown but thr view part is otherwise similar to the user image view.  
It is enabled for quick fixes of latest images, but we recommend to use the "user images" view instead.

The difference to "latest images" is twofold.
1) Drag and drop can change the order of images
2) The filter options above enable the appearance of selected images  
   It may be removed if we cant get it to work 2025.10.07
