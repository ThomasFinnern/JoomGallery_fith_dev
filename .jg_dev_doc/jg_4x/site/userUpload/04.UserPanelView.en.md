###  Display user images as manageable

This view part may not be shown as it can be switched of in the menu options

Images are managable in the sense that they can be reordered and filtered.
Here less imges are shown but thr view part is otherwise similar to the user image view.  
It is enable for quick fixes of latest images but we recommend to use the "user images" view instead.

The difference to "latest images" is twofold.
1) Drag and drop can change the order of images
2) The filter options above enable the appearance of selected images
