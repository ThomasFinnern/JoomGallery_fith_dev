This documentation is a work in progress and will be updated regularly. 
It is the collection of all markdown files from github
[Project documentation Repository](https://github.com/ThomasFinnern/JoomGallery_fith_dev/tree/main/.jg_dev_doc/jg_4x) 

Actually it contains updated added to JommGallery 4 by Thomas Finnern
 
There may be an updated version of this document. 
We may update it once in a while on new features. 

We are sorry for "some" ugly parts of the style. This results from the limitation of writing in fast "Markdown syntax".
